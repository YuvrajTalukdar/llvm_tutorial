1. Example code for generating a call graph using readymade functions provided by clang.
2. Example code for performing a DFS on the generated call graph.

3. Dumping the call graph directly using clang-
clang++ -Xclang -analyze -Xclang -analyzer-checker=debug.ViewCallGraph fun1.cpp
dot file gets saved in /tmt/ directory.

4. dot file to ps format (can be opened by Okular)
dot -Tps CallGraph-8f8ba7.dot -o out.ps
